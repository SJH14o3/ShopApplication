This is the second "Advanced Programming" course's project. Idea is we have a imaginary online shop that we can add items to carts, buy the cart, rate and comment on the bought item, participate at auctions and place bid and possibely win. this project was VERY VERY VERY heavy and the fact that two other students didn't participate as much as
they should made this much harder for me. we did not complete the project unforunately, a lot of admin part which was planned to be written by another student was not done but thanks to the bonus points, we got the full score barely! Also there is a PDF file explaining everything and two sql files for databases. I will say average score of this project
was very low, about 60 out of 100 and we got 104. We have used local sql for this and sql files are available. we didn't make a good database for comments and shopping cart and... . but products and auctions are fine. maybe not the auctions since they are timed and if you are getting this maybe all auctions has ran out of time!
Make sure to change the variable "PASSWORD" in global class to match your local sql to be able to use the database.
